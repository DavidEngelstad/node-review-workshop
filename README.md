#Exercise-1 <br />
Build out the GET, POST, and DELETE functions in handler.js in the node-server folder

#Exercise-2 <br />
Stop your server and comment out your server code in node-server/index.js. In express-server/index.js begin setting up your express server. Add a start script to your package.json that will run the server.

#Exercise-3 <br />
Inside your express-server folder, create a file called "routes.js" and a file called "controller.js". In your index.js file, make it so that requests coming in to the endpoint "/api" are routed to your express router. Inside your router file, route those requests to your controller. Inside your controller, build functionality to check (console.log) that each endpoint is being hit.
